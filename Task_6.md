# Task-5: Verifying The Functionality of VSD Mini Squadron Board By Implementing a Centade (0-99) BCD Counter


## BCD 

**BCD** stands for ***Binary-Coded Decimal***. A BCD counter is a type of counter used in digital electronics and computing to represent decimal numbers using binary-coded decimal format. In BCD format, each decimal digit (0-9) is represented by a 4-bit binary code. 

<br>
Example:

- Decimal `0` is represented as **`0000`** in BCD.
- Decimal `4` is represented as **`0100`** in BCD.
- Decimal `15` is represented as **`0001 0101`** in BCD.

## The Counter

### Overview 

Counters are fundamental components in digital electronics that are used to count, sequence, or track events. They play a crucial role in various electronic systems and have several applications across different fields including Frequency measurement & division, Event counting and monitoring etc,. I have created a BCD counter that counts from 0 to 99. When a push button (which act as clock) is pressed, the counter increments by one.


### Components Required

- VSD Mini Squadron Board
- 8 LEDs ( 4 Blue & 4 Red )
- Push button switch
- Jumper cables
- Bread board
- USB type-C or a 3.3V DC power source


### Hardware Connections
