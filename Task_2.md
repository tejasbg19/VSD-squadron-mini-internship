# Task-2 : Identify instruction type and exact 32-bit instruction code in the instruction type format. Upload the 32-bit pattern on Github 

And the given instructions are in the below image

To complete this task we first need to understand 32-bit RISC V (**RV32I**) instructions, their types & how they work.

# RV32I :

 RISC V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established **reduced instruction set computer (RISC)** principles. 
 And it has different types of instruction set we will be looking into a **Base Integer Instruction Set**.
 RV32I as the name suggests deals with the 32-bit instruction set. 
 Since our VSD squadron mini has 32-bit processor, let us know more about it.

 Just like any other instruction set architecture (ISA) riscv too has a syntax. Below image explains the syntax of a RV32I.
