# Task-1 : Installing & Setting Up The Tools

In this program we will be using **RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain** to compile our c programs into risc v instructions. 
Then we will be using **Iverilog** to compile & simulate our verilog files. 
We will be using **GTKwave** to view the relevant waveforms obtained from verilog simulation.
Also we will be using **Yosys** to synthesis our RTL.
